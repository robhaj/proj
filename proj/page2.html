Hi there! My name is Zelda. I was born into royalty and spend my nights and weekends battling evil. My closest friend is Link. Together we will rule the world.

With the skills I learn in the gSchool Full Stack program and a dedicated self-study, I will be prepared to start a career in web development. My main goal after gSchool is to get hired as a junior web developer with a company that I can build a reliable path for the future. I love Colorado but also enjoy moving to new places, so I wouldn't mind relocating to most places.
