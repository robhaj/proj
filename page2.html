    <p class="white">After gSchool I hope to have the skills necessary to excel as a Junior Web Developer. I'm really excited to have the oppurtunity to take this program. My main goal is to get hired with a promising company where I can make a path for advancement. Although I love Colorado and would prefer to stay here I would consider myself open to relocating with the right oppurtunity.
